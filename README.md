# Game Playing AI

## Combat mode
- When the different teamed agents are close to each other, they will start to attack each other. They are going to have certain health points. When the health points are 0, the agent will be removed from the game. 
- When no agents are close to each other, their health points will be restored.
- Dead agents will respawn in a random location after a certain amount of time.
